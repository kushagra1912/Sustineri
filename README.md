At Sustineri, our goal is to create awareness among people and incentives them to dispose of waste material appropriately.
Our website will contain directions to guide people on where and how to dispose of various kinds of waste, e.g., e-waste, biomedical waste, etc.
Upon proper disposal, we will reward our users based on the kind of material we dispose of; e.g., we will award more points for correctly disposing of tv than a mobile phone.
Using the points accumulated, the users will be able to purchase NFTs, which will gradually increase in value as the user-base increases and the NFTs gain popularity.
